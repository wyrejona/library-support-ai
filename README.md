# Library AI Backend

This project is a FastAPI-based backend that powers a public, no-login AI assistant
for answering questions using PDF documents (e.g. library policies, guides, manuals).

The assistant uses:
- OpenAI API (embeddings + chat)
- FAISS vector search
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

PDFs remain on your server. Only relevant excerpts are sent to OpenAI.
